            <div class="rule"><h2><span>Rule #1</span>Objective</h2>
                <p>The objective of the game is to win all the cards or most of them.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="rule"><h2><span>Rule #2</span>Number of Players</h2>
                <p>The game can be played with two players.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="rule"><h2><span>Rule #3</span>Setup</h2>
                <p>The deck is shuffled and divided evenly between the players. Each player takes their half of the deck and holds it face down, creating their own draw pile.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="rule"><h2><span>Rule #4</span>Gameplay</h2>
                <p>Both players simultaneously reveal the top card from their draw pile and place it face up on the table.</p>
                <p>The player who reveals the card with the higher rank (see below for ranking) wins both cards and adds them to the bottom of their own draw pile.</p>
                <p>If there is a tie (i.e., both players reveal cards of the same rank), it's called a "war".</p>
                <p>In a war, each player places three additional cards face down on the table, followed by one card face up. The player with the higher face-up card wins all the cards on the table and adds them to the bottom of their draw pile.</p>
                <p>If there's another tie during a war, the process repeats until one player's face-up card is higher than the other's.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="rule"><h2><span>Rule #5</span>Card Ranking</h2>
                <p>Cards are ranked in descending order from Ace (high) to 2 (low) based on their face value.</p>
                <p>The suit of the cards (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades) does not matter in this game.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="rule"><h2><span>Rule #6</span>Winning</h2>
                <p>Some variations of the game may include different rules for handling ties during a war or special rules for certain card combinations.</p>
